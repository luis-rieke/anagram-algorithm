# Algorith to check Anagrams

Little project for university where I check words for Anagrams.
When two or more words are composed of the same characters, but in a different order, they are called anagrams.

Example: `alger,glare,lager,large,regal`

&nbsp;

## Installing & Running

To start the algorith run `node algo.js`
